  <Title big>What is Flint?</Title>
  <Body>
    <Text big>
      Flint is a compiler for JS that gives you a live coding environment, delightful tools, and outputs clean, fast code.
    </Text>

    <p>
      It's a step back to the basics. There's one abstraction: views, they replace HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a big framework
      with just JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Views have variables, structure and style. When a variable changes, your view updates.

      Flint is learnable in a few minutes.

      It's also low risk. If you want to stop using it, continue from the clean compiled code.

    <Title>Live Coding</Title>
    <p>
       Flint was designed from the start to support Live Coding.
       Painters don't have to refresh their canvases, as it should be with programming.
    </p>

    <p>
       With each keystroke, we analyze your change and inject your it to your app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Errors (compile, runtime, and type) appear immediately and helpfully on your canvas.
      It's truly an evolution in creativity.
    </p>

    <Title>Principles</Title>

    <p>
      Throughout the process of building there are countless moments where ease of
      experimentation unlocks entirely new paths. You stumble on solutions only
      because you have fast and lightweight tools.
      Closeness to your canvas brings a great ability to create.
    </p>
