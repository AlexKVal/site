    <IntroText>Flint is focused on making building modern web applications easier, faster, and more fun than ever before.</IntroText>

    <p>
      Flint is a compiler for JS that gives you a live coding environment, delightful tools, and outputs clean code in any framework(starting with React).
      <br/>
      It's a step back to the basics. There's one abstraction: views, which contain HTML and JS. When variables change, your views stays up to date.
      <br/>
      Flint is less code than any framework and takes only a few minutes to learn completely.
      <br/>
      It is also low risk to use. If you want to stop using it, continue from the clean compiled code in your preferred framework.

    <h4>Live Coding</h4>
    <p>
       Flint was designed from the start to support Live Coding. 
       Painters don't have to refresh their canvases each stroke, and it should be no different in programming.
       <br/>
       With each keystroke, we analyze your change and inject your chance into your running app in less than a single frame. Any errors(compile, runtime, and type-check) are shown to you immediately. Live Coding feels natural, and it is hard to return to the old way of doing things.
     </p>

    <h4>Principles</h4>

    <p>Throughout the process of building there are countless moments where ease of experimentation unlocks entirely new paths. You stumble on solutions only because you have fast and lightweight tools. Closeness to your canvas brings greater ability to create.</p>
