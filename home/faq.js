    <question>
      What can I build with it?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Flint has all the power of React, so just about anything!
        We're focusing on making the developer experience as good as possible,
        opening up the community to build and release cool stuff for it.
        Flint is already in use at Zappos, Quixey and a variety of companies
        powering apps, internal tools, and websites.

    <question>
      What are "ultra-fast" hot reloads?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        In general, you should see faster reloads than other systems.
        Flint's static analyzer is built from the ground up to optimize for live development.
        By only injecting the code that you changed into your running app, we can
        provide near-instant save-to-refresh times no matter how large your app grows.

    <question>
      Can I use it in my existing stack?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        You also can embed your Flint
        app into any page, so you could easily plug it into an existing
        web app today. We're working on plugins, but we strong suggest
        trying out the CLI. Part of our speed difference is in the design
        of the build system.

    <question>
      What about Flux, GraphQL, or data management in general?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        You can build Flux into Flint using npm, and we are exploring
        ways to make GraphQL a first class citizen (and a lot easier
        to use). At the moment, we'd recommend building without Flux,
        and crossing that bridge when the time comes. We will be talking
        more about good ways to handle data soon.
