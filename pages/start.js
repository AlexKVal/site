    <Text>
      Flint is early so there are less resources to find around the web, but fear not!

    <Text>
      We have a few large apps we've been building ourselves, with friends and with companies over the last
      few months that can serve as your example.
    </Text>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="">FlashCash</Link> - A simple one-off site that integrates firebase, accounts and payments
      </li>

      <li>
        <Link href="https://github.com/flintjs/site">Flint.js Homepage</Link> - Our homepage has over 200 views, it's not very dynamic but we've tried to keep it well written (besides the globals).
      </li>

      <li>
        <Link href="https://github.com/natew/arena">Arena</Link> - A simple portfolio site that uses a simple REST API. Uses async/await and fetch together to show some advanced fetching patterns as well as routes
      </li>
    </ul>
