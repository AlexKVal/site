  <Text>We've found that Flint can be learned quicky by those who have programmed in JS before.</Text>
  <Text>Our <a href="https://flintjs.com/docs">documentation</a> can help you learn more specific features of Flint and our <a href="https://github.com/flintjs/examples">examples repo</a> has a variety of small examples showing working code.</Text>
  <Text>We're working on an online live <a href="http://learn.flintjs.com">interactive code editor</a>, but it's <em>not yet ready</em>, we'll notify you once it's up.</Text>

    Flint Examples
  </Title>

  <Text>
    Flint is early so there are less resources to find around the web, but fear not!
  </Text>

  <Text>
    We have a few large apps we've been building ourselves, with friends and with companies over the last
    few months that can serve as your example.

  <ul>
    <li if={false}>
      <Link href="">FlashCash</Link> - A simple one-off site that integrates firebase, accounts and payments
    </li>

    <li>
      <Link href="https://github.com/flintjs/site">Flint.js Homepage</Link> - Our homepage has over 200 views, it's not very dynamic but we've tried to keep it well written.
    </li>

    <li>
      <Link href="https://github.com/natew/arena">Arena</Link> - A simple portfolio site that uses a simple REST API. Uses async/await and fetch together to show some advanced fetching patterns as well as routes

  <Text>We're excited to have you. As part of Spark, you will have access to our newest tools that will be released after launch.</Text>

  <Text>We'll be featuring many of your projects in early January during our launch, and using your feedback to help decide which features to focus on.</Text>

  <Text>We're looking forward to seeing what you build and hearing your feedback.</Text>

  <Text>
    Here's some help getting started with Flint. We'll assume you're really starting from scratch on a new machine.

  <Text>Flint's founders (Nick and Nate) will be joining you in Spark by building Groop, a fun group chat app where votes can decide any action, small spontaneous games can take place, and generaly tomfoolery can be had.</Text>

  <groop-img src="/assets/images/groop.png" />

  <Text>We'll be open sourcing Groop and using it as a way to teach Flint. We'll try to provide weekly updates in the Slack channel</Text>
