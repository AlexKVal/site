    <answer>
      <p>
        Flint has all the power of React, so just about anything!
        We're focusing on making the developer experience as good as possible,
        opening up the community to build and release cool stuff for it.

      <p>
        Flint is already in use at Zappos, Quixey and a variety of companies
        powering apps, internal tools, and websites.

    <question>
      What are "fast" hot reloads?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        In general, you should see faster reloads than other systems.
        Flint has done some optimization to make this possible.
        Due to view macros and other optimizations we avoid a lot of
        work during compilation.

    <question>
      Can I use it in my existing stack?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        You also can embed your Flint
        app into any page, so you could easily plug it into an existing
        web app today.
